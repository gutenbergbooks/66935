<p>“There is a connection [<i>verbindung</i>] among men, in which no one can work
for himself without working for others.”&mdash;<i>Fichte.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The tie of mutual influence passes without a break from hand to hand,
throughout the human family. There is no independence, no insulation, in the
lot of man.”&mdash;<i>Natural History of Enthusiasm.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There is a tendency to regard the commotions of society, which
have taken place of late years, as the results of modern diplomacy,
or of notions concerning human rights, which have received birth
and risen to their present vigor within the last fifty years. Hence,
it is argued, there is a liability to reaction. The bright lights may
go out, and despotism triumph in the moral and political degeneracy.
Yet this view of the matter is very superficial. It is regarding the
trunk as the origin of the tree, overlooking the seed and the root.
The truth is, the principles now developing have their origin with
society. For, all sound political principles have a common foundation&mdash;the
rights of man. His selfishness, especially his thirst for
sway, aided by ignorance, has kept through force and fraud the true
principles of human government from being understood and adopted.
Still the ancient kingdoms, the world-empires and all, though now
in their tombs, left inscriptions on their head-stones of diamond worth
to the science of government. They are beacon-lights for the modern
statesman. Their wisdom and their folly, both aid him to discover
the true rules for human government, which have been buried
up and concealed by folly and passion since the days of the Patriarchs,
from whom all civil authority had its rise. Added to this
light of experience, collected by by-gone nations, are other influences
of a physical nature. The application of the magnet to purposes
of navigation, was one of those master thoughts, which, from
its vast importance, we are almost tempted to regard as an idea of
directly divine origin. The influence of this on the whole family of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
man, can be best estimated by suffering one’s self to think what the
state of the world would of necessity be, were it entirely unknown.
Again, the application of steam to machinery, is not only changing
the aspect of things in the New World and Europe, but this invention
was a positive act for the moral and physical renovation of Asia and
Africa&mdash;an act of such power as must hasten their new birth by centuries.
British steamers are already on their way to explore the Niger.
It is the operation and display of this vast physical force, which
is to be a great means of starting into action the stagnated mind of this
part of our race. These discoveries, it will readily be allowed, can
never cease to operate. Entwined with political experience, they
stand firm barriers to any relapse in the general well being of the
human family; while, year after year, to these and others, which
cannot be mentioned in the limits of a single article, are added the
discoveries of physical and political science, as they occur, until
their increasing light reveals to the common eye, one and another,
and another, of the rights of man, which designing men, “tyrants,
or tyrants’ slaves,” have striven to conceal. Almost every nation
of the earth has had some of its dark places pierced by these accumulating
rays. Despotic powers have been forced to yield up some
part of the prerogatives of the crown, or to surround them with
stronger guards. Constitutional governments have been compelled
to adopt measures of reform, and to pursue a course of policy more
uniformly liberal.</p>

<p>Amid these commotions, no nations have more attracted the attention
of all classes, than Turkey and Greece. The politician
has watched with no little anxiety the rapid dismemberment of that
power, which has so long stood the great barrier between the East
and West. The scholar has felt a new hope that the mother-land
of mental light may be herself again. While the Christian is assured
that the Almighty is thus shaking the nations for the accomplishment
of his own high ends. He is but making straight the
path of his servants.</p>

<p>The history of the Turks is remarkable and instructive&mdash;in the
sudden rise of their empire&mdash;in its long continuance&mdash;and precipitate
fall. The wild region of Mount Taurus and Imaus was their
cradle. At once the most barbarous, the rudest, and the most enterprising
of all the Saracen tribes, they penetrated to the banks of
the Caspian Sea, and serving as mercenaries under the Caliphs, acquired
great reputation for military prowess, and soon subjugated the
contending Caliphats to their own sway. Palestine, with its capital
Jerusalem, fell into their hands. Near the middle of the fourteenth
century, they crossed into Europe, and possessed themselves
of Adrianople. In a few years subsequent to this event, the city
of Constantine, to adorn which he had lavished the treasures of his
realm, was doomed to see their triumphant banner floating above
her walls. Epirus soon suffered the fate of Constantinople; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
the land of the orator and philosopher, which built a bulwark against
Xerxes, received their chains. They marched victorious even to
the walls of Vienna; but were finally driven back as far as Greece.
European arms could avail no farther. In other directions this remarkable
people were uniformly successful; until, in the sixteenth
century, the Sultan was lord of thirty kingdoms, containing not less
than eight thousand leagues of sea coast, and some of the fairest
portions of the world. Not only those regions which have been
rendered famous as the homes of the great masters of sculpture,
song and philosophy, but the land of the Patriarchs, where were
exhibited the thrilling scenes of the accomplishment of the covenant
of God with man&mdash;Baghdad, the court of the science-loving
Caliphs&mdash;Egypt&mdash;and the countries of Asia Minor, whose luxuriance
not even Turkish thraldom and indolence has sufficed to destroy.</p>

<p>But this great empire was in itself radically defective. The government
depended on extortion for its revenue&mdash;on physical force
or a degrading imposture for obedience; neither of which, whatever
may have been the case in other days, could be safely trusted, in
the light which is breaking over the human family, and over the
Turks as a part of it. The present Sultan found himself in the dilemma
between reform on the one hand, in accomplishing which his
throne, and perhaps his life would be jeopardized, and certain destruction
on the other. In choosing the least of these evils, Greece,
Egypt, and Palestine, were severed from his empire. Mahomet
Ali would have attacked him in his capital, but for the interposition
of the Tzar, who was fearful of losing a prize which has ever been
the object of Muscovite ambition, the throne of Constantine. But
while the black Eagle of Russia spread his wings as a shelter for
the Turk, he coolly seized in his talons the keys of the Dardanelles;
thus rendering any further interposition on the part of England,
who has so often balked the Tzar in his darling project, entirely
futile. Since which event, the fall of Turkey has been pronounced
as certain by all. What is to be its precise effect on the politics
of Europe, is a question which only a Talleyrand or a Metternich
could answer with any probability of truth. Yet the foregoing
remarks exhibit facts from which consequences of high importance
must follow.</p>

<p>They exhibit the empire of the Ottomans as once occupying a
proud station among the greater powers&mdash;as forming a boundary
and preserving a balance between the East and West&mdash;as a firm
check on Muscovite ambition&mdash;and as, from her consequence, possessing
great weight in the councils of nations; and it is apparent
that she cannot fall without important political consequences.</p>

<p>They exhibit her with a religion, which has ever been a bane to
all nobler sentiments or aspirations of the soul, brooding like night
over some of the fairest portions of the earth, blasting by the baleful
influence of her institutions the legitimate effect, both on mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
and body, of her naturally fair plains, rich vallies, and brilliant skies,
which, in other times, produced models for an Apollo Belvidere
and a Venus de Medici, and nourished men who were masters of
the earth and of mind; and it is evident that she cannot fall without
important consequences to the beaux Arts and Literature.</p>

<p>They exhibit her, as the main support and promoter of the debasing,
sensual tenets of Mahomet, in countries where the Apostles,
and even Christ, toiled and suffered. They exhibit her, as the
systematic opposer of the message of the Prince of Peace, to her
distracted provinces&mdash;the only balm for their wounds&mdash;the only
physician for their souls; and the effect of her fall on the highest
of interests cannot be unimportant.</p>

<p>What then is to be the influence of the prostration of the Ottoman
sway in these cradles of early knowledge, upon literature, science,
and the beaux arts?</p>

<p>Winklemann, in his history of sculpture, assigns as a principal
reason of the superiority of the Greeks in that sublime art over
other nations, the circumstance of their inhabiting a land so surpassingly
endowed by nature; and with much truth. Their bodies, neither
chilled nor contracted by the long winters of the north, nor
softened into lassitude and effeminacy by the tropical sun, but continually
moving and breathing in the purest air, under the mildest
and most brilliant of skies, whose loveliness was constantly exciting
in the mind the most agreeable trains of thought, attained, in their
fair proportions, to a harmonious keeping with the beauty around.</p>

<p>Close observation must convince every candid mind, that there is
some truth in the grand outlines of Phrenology. Forms such as
aided in the conception of those master pieces of ancient statuary,
were never, and never will be, inhabited by inferior or grovelling
spirits. Vitiated they may be by extraneous circumstances. Their
noble faculties may be turned to unworthy purposes. Corrupted by
long intercourse with the morally debased, they may, like the modern
Greek, suffer the imputation of being worse than their examples.
But this is the proof of the position. They are bad, but
like Lucifer they are greatly so.</p>

<p>How long is this to be the case with Greece? Emphatically no
longer. Already by the aid of the missionary and foreign science,
she is realizing the fable of the renascent phenix; already are those
whose beauty of person long years of servitude have been unable to
destroy, renewing the moral beauty of the spirit within; already are
they turning those powers which made them remarkable in depravity
to their proper channels. And he, whose love for the human
family, or reverence for the classic scenes of Greece, has led him to
peruse the late accounts from thence: if he has observed the avidity
with which they seek instruction, when they once taste of its sweets:
if he has noticed their teachable spirit, rapid improvement, exhibitions
of ingenuity and taste: his bosom has exulted in the sober certainty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
that Greece will be herself again. But why has this fair morn
at last dawned over this singularly illustrious land? The answer is
plain. Mahometan despotism and ignorance no longer hold sway
within her borders. If this be so, what is to be the effect of the removal
of Turkish intolerance and misrule, and the establishment of
an enlightened and responsible government over the shores of the
Levant, in the same parallels of latitude? Are the fields of Anatolia
less rich than those of Greece, or her harbors less promising for
commerce? or are the Greeks, scattered through those regions, who
at least double the number of those in their father-land, less capable
of moral improvement? Is the conclusion drawn from unfair premises,
that the day of the deliverance of this country is near&mdash;that the
angel of knowledge will again spread his wings over Anatolia, Palestine,
Arabia, Egypt, her ancient home? The conclusion is not, can
not be false. The same physical influences operate now as in days
of old, though the misrule of man may have marred their effects.
The same high cast of mind is there which won immortality for their
fathers: and why may not spring up in those regions, under a wiser
government, and a purer religion, a people, in arts and science even
superior to the ancients? Why may there not arise, under the auspices
of virtue and wisdom, new models for a Venus or an Apollo?
Why may not the Parian marble there rise into temples of as fair
proportions as that of Olympus or of Minerva, reared for nobler purposes,
dedicated to a far higher and holier worship?</p>

<p>The influence of the subversion of the greatest rival of the Christian
church, is a subject replete with interest. When the mere politician,
unswayed by the fond hope which might influence the Christian’s
decision, publishes to the world as certain the prostration of
Turkey&mdash;when the disciple of Jesus may at length point the startled
infidel to the tottering fabric of Mahometanism, which he has impiously
dared to name as co-enduring and co-equal with the pure
Christian faith, and bid him look on, as column after column is torn
away from the crumbling structure, as Immanuel is triumphing
where Mahomet ruled&mdash;when the finger of the Almighty is writing
as palpably the sentence of this unparalleled imposture as when it
traced on the wall the doom of Babylon&mdash;what heart does not glow
with deeper gratitude, overflow with more fervent thanksgivings, and
pray with strengthened faith?</p>

<p>The time is to be when “nations shall be born in a day:” and
from the ardent character of the east, it seems not improbable that
it is to be witness of this latter as it was of the former triumphing of
the cross.</p>

<p>It is an especial appointment of providence, that nations more advanced
in civilization must necessarily labor for the improvement of
those which are less so. So the East once labored for the West.
Now the nations of the west, with their Institutions of Learning&mdash;their
Presses&mdash;their Forges&mdash;their Dock Yards&mdash;working together
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
for the perfection of human knowledge, and for facilitating its diffusion&mdash;pour
light of constantly increasing brightness over the East.
Still greater commotions must soon follow in these early inhabited
regions. Their renovation must advance rapidly and steadily.
There may and doubtless will be times of apparent retrogradation,
but it will be like the flood-tide waves, which roll back from the
shore only to mount still higher on their return. It may be said
that these things are uncertain, because they are future; but it is
not necessarily so. The diffusion of sound political principles, and
the rising of the Sun of Righteousness over these nations, seem as
clearly heralded by these events, as is the coming of the material
sun when morning is breaking in the east, the night-damps leaving
the earth, the clouds decking themselves in gold and purple, and all
nature waking for the duties of a new day.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I stood beside his death-bed, and a smile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the last glance of the departing sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Played on his features; life was ebbing fast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death was creeping o’er him stealthily&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet he smiled, as the last hour came on.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">We gathered round him, and his eye grew dim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his voice faltered, and the shortening breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came through his parted lips convulsively&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The last faint accents of a murmured prayer:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then we turned us from his couch, and wept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the dear ties were severed, which had bound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hearts in kindred intercourse:&mdash;We grieved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he whom we had loved so tenderly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should pass away with the forgotten dead.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, there is something saddening in the thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of death, whene’er it comes. To stand beside</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The death-bed of a dear and cherished one;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mark the tristful pangs, the hopes and fears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see the perishing form of loveliness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hear the last fond parting word&mdash;<i>farewell!</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then to gaze upon the lifeless form,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To part the damp locks from the marble brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wipe the death-dews which have gather’d there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lay the sleeper in his narrow house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leave him with the cold and listless dead,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, it is saddening!&mdash;and the tide of tears&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warm, warm tears, that gush from feeling hearts&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, they are holy!&mdash;And there is a bliss,</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When the heart swells with anguish, and when grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chokes up the spirit in its agony&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, there is something&mdash;and ’tis like the dew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which evening sheds upon the summer flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And weighs it down, until it bows itself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pours the bright drops from its secret cell.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, holy is the fountain of those tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pure their gushing. &emsp;’Tis a holy thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To weep at such an hour. &emsp;’Tis manliness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To yield the heart to feeling, and to loose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shackles that so cramp its energies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bind it down to the unfeeling world.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet why thus mourn for those who die, when age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has made existence but a weariness?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why grieve that they should cast aside the coil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That binds them to the earth and wretchedness?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">We do not weep at Autumn; when the leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lie in the valleys&mdash;mortals never weep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the tree casts its fruitage, or when flowers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blooming through the mild months, all fade away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In their appointed season: Then why weep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For those whose years have passed the destined bourne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of man’s existence.&mdash;Rather let us weep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the young flower that blossometh and dies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere it hath seen the noon-day. Rather mourn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For those, the sweet and beautiful of earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who die in youth’s bright morning.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Tears for the flowers, and the young buds of hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That wreathe Death’s altar:&mdash;let us weep for them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But let us dash away the sorrowing tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That falls upon the aged sleeper’s grave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And joy that he has left this sinful world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sought a purer and a happier sphere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where sorrow never comes, and where no care</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blanches the cheek, and makes the spirit sad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where sin hath never entered, to pollute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The perfect sense of happiness; where all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The great and good of earth for ever dwell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the soft sun-shine of <i>Eternal youth</i>.</div>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> An “Omnibus” (this explanation is one of pure politeness on our part, and for
the sake of the uninitiated) is a substitute for an Album; in which, any thing, every
thing, and nothing, are quartered heterogeneously, and made good friends&mdash;supposing
all this time that the thing be kept within the pale of proprieties. They
are with, or without covers&mdash;written in black or red ink&mdash;up or down&mdash;crossways
or otherwise, just as it happens. They were first got up by a certain <i>coterie</i> of ladies,
who had sense enough to see that “Albums” are very sentimental and very
ridiculous, owing to the extreme nicety with which a man must scribble for them;
and that by introducing a little more latitude in this respect, the evil might in a
measure be remedied. The result, ’tis thought, has shown their wisdom.</p>

</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“Come, write in my ‘Omnibus,’” said a sweet girl to me, with an
eye that made one’s heart bump, and a lip that made him dream
dreams. I looked into that eye, and at that lip&mdash;they almost unmanned
me, yet I shook my head.</p>

<p>She looked imploringly.</p>

<p>“Can’t,” stammered I at last, though it choked me to say so.</p>

<p>“Pray do,” and she laid her soft white hand on mine. Heavens
and Earth! how the touch of that little hand thrilled through me&mdash;burnt
along my arm&mdash;then down into my heart. Yet I remembered
my resolution&mdash;I made it the day before&mdash;I swore by my happiness
I’d never touch pen again. Still, there lay that hand&mdash;the
long tapering fingers&mdash;I counted them one way, then t’other&mdash;how
pretty they looked! I tried to look away&mdash;I looked at the
four corners of heaven&mdash;some how or other, my eyes came right
back again. Then I felt a soft pressure, those fingers contracted,
they clasped&mdash;it was all over with me&mdash;the grasp of Hercules were
nothing to it.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to kiss them&mdash;the next, find my senses.
She blushed, I fidgeted.</p>

<p>“Think out something”&mdash;the sound was like a brook in summer.</p>

<p>So I thought, and thought, and thought&mdash;</p>

<p>Thought I was by the ocean. Every body has stood by the
ocean. Every body loves the ocean. They love it because ’tis
beautiful. They love it because ’tis terrible. Who that could
ever tell his passions, as he has seen the giant rouse himself&mdash;the
black sky split by the thunder-bolt, and so brazen and fiery that it
seemed crisping, and “about to roll away with a great noise”&mdash;the
driving wind&mdash;the bellowing thunder&mdash;the crashing deck&mdash;the rattling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
cordage&mdash;the death shriek of the sea-shipped wretch as the
wave went over him&mdash;the horror-like eye’s last glance upon you!
But I don’t mean such an ocean. It wasn’t such an one that I was
standing by. It was a pretty considerable, magnificent, almighty,
great sheet of water as far as the eye went, with a sky above that
made one’s heart leap to look at it&mdash;its depth of blue seeming to
stretch away and away, field after field, without a mist or cloud in it
to mar its beauty&mdash;one unbounded, unshadowed sweep of glory and
magnificence. The winds, soft and balmy, went whirling and whimpering
along its surface, curling and crinkling it into small white
waves, that, racing and capering up the beach, sparkled and turned
into bubbles, and were caught up by the sun beams. Here
and there the waters break. The huge porpoise went plunging,
and sousing, and weltering along his blue path, flapping his huge tail
into the air, and grunting his happiness&mdash;the bright light refracted
from his surface, came to the eye like a rainbow. Here and there
the flying fish slipped from his element, and went careering away
over the far waters, till with a light dash or slap, his white wings
dipped again into the ocean. The distance had one sail, a single
one, right on the horizon’s edge&mdash;type, methought, of a being shut
from the world&mdash;a human heart cut loose from sympathy&mdash;on the
black desert of man’s pilgrimage. Such was the scene. I felt it. I
rose, and stood, and shouted, and&mdash;</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Thought I was down in the ocean&mdash;right on the bottom. Whew!
what a place it was!&mdash;saw all sorts of things, living and dead&mdash;all
colors, good and bad&mdash;all shapes, hateful and fascinating. Here I
wandered through endless groves of coral. Aloft went the light
shafts tapering away into the blue distance, then branching forth into
a glorious canopy, through which came the broken light with a mellowed
beauty, not unlike the sun’s beams through a polished fresco-worken
slab of alabaster. The waves swung backwards and forwards
through this submarine forest, and their rush made the tall
shafts quiver like aspen boughs in the tempest wind; and the light
coral twigs, here and there detached by the waters, fell thick and fast
like star showers in wintry nights. Nor should I forget the sounds of
those waters as they tossed up the shells which were scattered there,
and witched from them a music, that tripped and tilted through the
brain, like Mab and her melodies in moonlight vision. It changed!
I was in a desert! Rocks and barren surfaces above, beneath, around
me! Wild cliffs&mdash;rent fastnesses&mdash;deep chasms&mdash;yawning and gaping
like the cleft jaws of Hell! They had wrecks, and ruins, and
dead men, and skeletons, and skulls in them. Here were fragments
of those mighty tenements, that once rode in triumph on the wave’s
surface. There were those black engines, wont to belch forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
“their devilish glut,” and flame, and thunder. Here were skeletons&mdash;some
hugging in mortal conflict. They were grappled together,
as when death overtook them&mdash;their jaws yet apart, as the
last curse dwelt on them, the moment the bolt came. There were
friends too, parent and child, husband and wife, lover and maiden&mdash;laid
as they died, locked heart to heart, each on the other’s breast,
the two a unity. I sickened, shuddered, gasped&mdash;</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Thought I was in a forest&mdash;a bright, a green, a glorious forest.
My heart ached, and I had turned from the heated world and its
miseries, and where the lofty branches had intertwined and woven
a pleasant twilight dwelling place, I sat me down to meditate. Then
I scribbled and scribbled&mdash;and thus, I scribbled&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">This is indeed a sacred solitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And beautiful as sacred. Here no sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save such as breathes a soft tranquillity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falls on the ear; and all around, the eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meets nought but hath a moral. These deep shades&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With here and there an upright trunk of ash</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or beech or nut, whose branches interlaced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’ercanopy us, and, shutting out the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A twilight make&mdash;they press upon the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With force amazing and unutterable.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These trunks enormous, from the mountain side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ripp’d roots and all by whirlwinds&mdash;those vast pines</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Athwart the ravine’s melancholy gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Transversely cast&mdash;these monarchs of the wood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dark, gnarl’d, centennial oaks that throw their arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So proudly up&mdash;those monstrous ribs of rock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, shiver’d by the thunder-stroke, and hurl’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From yonder cliff, their bed for centuries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here crush’d and wedged&mdash;all by their massiveness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And silent strength, impress us with a sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Deity. And here are wanted not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More delicate forms of beauty. Numerous tribes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of natural flowers do blossom in these shades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meet for the scene alone. At ev’ry step,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some beauteous combination of soft hues,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Less brilliant though than those which deck the fields,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eye attracts. Mosses of softest green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Creep round the trunks of the decayed trees;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mosses, hueless as the mountain snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inlay the turf. Here, softly peeping forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eye detects the little violet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such as the city boasts&mdash;of paler hue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But fragrant more. The simple forest flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that pale gem the wind flower, falsely named,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here greet the cautious search&mdash;less beautiful</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than poets feign, though lovely to the eye.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These with their modest forms so delicate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And breath of perfume, send th’ unwilling heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all its aspirations, to the source</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Life and Light. Nor woodland sounds are wanting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such as the mind to that soft melancholy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The poet feels, lull soothingly. The winds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are playing with the forest tops in glee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And music make. Sweet rivulets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slip here and there from out the crevices</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rifled rocks, and, welling ’mid the roots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of prostrate trees or blocks transversely east,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Form jets of driven snow. Soft symphonies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of birds unseen, on ev’ry side swell out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if the spirit of the wood complain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Harmonious, and most prodigal of sound;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And these can woo the spirit with such power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tune it to a mood so exquisite&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the enthusiast heart forgets the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its strifes, and follies&mdash;and seeks only here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To satisfy its thirst for happiness.</div>
  </div>

<p>Thought I was in love. Heavens! what a creature she was!
Her form was like a fairy’s; and her face, about which the flaxen
ringlets fell long, and soft, and silky, was at once so arch and sweet,
it witched the very soul out of me before I knew it. Her picture
is before me.&mdash;Her head like Juno’s, when she walked before the
Olympic Thunderer, and yet a woman’s; her brow, high, and white,
and pure; eyes of heaven’s own coloring, and bright, and ustrous,
and large, and full, in whose crystalline depths slept a soul such as&mdash;as&mdash;you
must guess at, reader, I can’t think of a comparison; a
cheek, the eloquent beauty of which melted away so gradually into
the pure transparency of her temples, that the eye lost it, and was
wandering away, up, and around them, before it became aware of its
own vagaries; and her mouth&mdash;Heavens and Earth! it was altogether
and absolutely, the sweetest, prettiest, pouting, come-kiss-me,
little mouth, I ever looked at; and her voice&mdash;her voice&mdash;how clear
and musical&mdash;there was nothing like her clear, happy laugh&mdash;it rung
like an instrument&mdash;like the silvery bell in the Faery Tale; and
when she prettily bade me sit at her feet, and look up into her clear
bright eyes&mdash;pooh! I might as well have attempted to knock Destiny
on the head at once, and steer the boat of life myself, as keep
from doing her bidding; and her form, robed as she was in her white
cymar, with a single rose in her hair&mdash;the neck&mdash;the full bust&mdash;the
rounded arm&mdash;the graceful curvature and wavy sweep of her folded
dress, as it swelled from her glittering zone and fell to her feet&mdash;dear
me! dear me&mdash;I&mdash;but this will do for a description.</p>

<p>Her name was Fan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>One beautiful twilight&mdash;I shan’t forget it soon&mdash;one twilight, as
the sun went, and right over his glorious resting place, the clouds
of evening, like an enormous sweep of woven chrysolite, hung pinned
by a single star to the blue wall of heaven&mdash;I sat and gazed at
that star, then into her eyes; now into her eyes, and then at that
star again; and&mdash;I grew silly.</p>

<p>Says I, “Fan!”</p>

<p>Says she, “Frank!”</p>

<p>“You are very pretty,” says Frank.</p>

<p>“You are very impudent,” says Fan.</p>

<p>She shook her head at me, and drew her mouth into the queerest
pucker imaginable.</p>

<p>“Fanny,” said I seriously.</p>

<p>She sobered.</p>

<p>Some how or other, I got hold of her hand&mdash;’twas a pretty hand!
I kissed it.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly;” and she gave me a cuff that made me see stars.</p>

<p>“Fanny, I”&mdash;</p>

<p>She looked softly at me.</p>

<p>“Dearest Fanny, I”&mdash;</p>

<p>She pouted.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I”&mdash;</p>

<p>She blushed.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;love you.”</p>

<p>She sprang into my arms.</p>

<p>Bending back her head, and shaking her long locks from her
pretty brow, our lips&mdash;</p>

<p>Hillo! reader, you are not getting sentimental, are you? Don’t
now; for I’ve no sympathy with you&mdash;no more sentiment than a horse.</p>

<p>But stop; here’s a bit, and written when things were tremendous.
<i>Ecce signum!</i></p>

<p>Thought I was with my mother. Mother! reader, hast thou a
mother? not a mere nominal parent&mdash;one who brought thee into
the world, and then left thee to struggle in’t&mdash;one who gave thee
but a moiety of her tenderness? Nay, nay; I do not mean such.
But I mean, one whose very life was wrapp’d up in thee, one whose
eye moistened with thine, whose voice faltered with thine, whose
heart reflected every shadow which passed over thy heart, even as
a lake the summer clouds, that idle above its bosom. Such an one
I mean&mdash;hadst ever such? I had&mdash;and how I loved her. Did I
not?&mdash;the following verses prove it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Virtue&mdash;with the first dawn of infant mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Falling from lips that made it holier seem;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Goodness&mdash;when deeds with precept were combined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To show the world&mdash;“religion is no dream;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tears&mdash;when my heart was all too sad to weep them,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Watching&mdash;when none but love like thine could keep them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rebukes&mdash;yet with a blessing in thine eye;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An eye that watch’d me and would never sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A well-timed word to keep me in the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A look, that made me go from thee and weep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A faith, that made thee watch, and kneel, and pray&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These, these are thine&mdash;O! sweet are then to me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mother! the thoughts of home, of my sweet home, and thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus I valued her. But she’s in her grave now, and I often go
there to watch and weep, and please myself with the vain fancy,
that her spirit is bending over me. I always feel holier after it&mdash;as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
if I had come from another world&mdash;had been beyond the grave&mdash;had
unravelled the great mysteries of life and death, and could now
look upon life unsway’d by that natural Atheism which ever clings
to humanity, and mingles in all our aspirations for the future.
Watching and prayer ever better us. But by the grave of a loved
one, there are still holier influences. We see them through the
mirror of feeling. If they had faults, they have them no longer;
and their virtues, we canonize them&mdash;they are relics&mdash;they are talismans
which we lay on our hearts, and they are holier for the contact.</p>

<p>Earth’s thoughts come not to the grave’s side. The idle, the
giddy and gay, they do not jest here&mdash;the song of triumph ceases,
the unfinished quip dies on the lip that made it. The famed, the
haughty, the ambitious, they bring not their proud thoughts with
them&mdash;they tread its holy precincts, and their schemes are forgotten.
The school boy’s whistle is lower here, and the butterfly he
chases so eagerly, scales the white palings and escapes&mdash;he will not
follow him. The very flowers that bloom here, the osiers that
swathe the grave of that little one and twine about the head stones&mdash;they
teach us by their freshness, and our thoughts stir up the fountains
in us, and the heart is hallowed by it.</p>

<p>Come hither, thou parent&mdash;a father perhaps. This was thy
heart’s pride and passion. Hope and promise were his. You had
already marked his path. Here were the flowers&mdash;there the thorns.
You saw him in fancy, out of his boyhood&mdash;the youth&mdash;the young
man&mdash;his cheek glowing for the contest. Death came&mdash;and you
laid him here.</p>

<p>Come hither, thou parent&mdash;a mother perhaps. This was thy
first born. You bore him on your heart; you nursed him; you
hung over him; you wept and prayed for him as mothers only can
do; and <i>you</i> too, have laid him here. The little form you decked
so&mdash;the locks that swung over a brow of silver&mdash;the face with its
beauty, and light, and sweetness, and all the innocency of happy
childhood&mdash;the clear silver shout of his joy&mdash;the step that ran to
thee&mdash;the lip that pouted for the morning and evening kiss&mdash;aye!
here they are&mdash;look at them.</p>

<p>And who art thou, mourner?&mdash;thou that lookest not up to the
glorious sky, or abroad on the fair face of the creation of God; but,
wrapped in the selfishness and solitude of thy grief, standest here
like a lone monument of dead men’s histories&mdash;who art thou?
Thine eye is on that slab there; ’tis a maiden’s. Thou lovedst her
perhaps; her heart beat to thee; her lip was free to thy wooing.
She was decked for a bridal; the rite had sealed her thine; and
death strewed thy bridal couch with rosemary, and rue, and the
gloomy cypress.</p>

<p>And what do these here? They come here to weep, for it sanctifies
them. They come from the roar, and bustle, and heartlessness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
of life, and they would listen awhile to the eloquence of the
shrouded dead. O! the dead are eloquent! The voice is low, yet
louder than that of many waters! They tell us that our loved ones
were not ours! They tell us that they were lent to us, and have now
been reclaimed! They tell us, that though saddening, ’tis sweet
to think of them, for they tie us and our souls to the purity of
Heaven!</p>

<p>Some men shudder as they look into a grave; and well they
may, some of the world. But the heart is wrong which feels thus.
Does the sight of land give pain to the shipwrecked? is the hope
of freedom unwelcome at the dungeon? does the sound of waters
please in the desert? does the thought of sleep annoy us when
weary? does the hope of oblivion give pain when the heart aches?
Why then should the thought of what is greater gain than all these
come to our hearts, but to waken their holiest emotions?</p>

<p><i>No est tan bravo il leon, como se pinta</i>&mdash;the lion is not so fierce

your exclamation, fair, gentle, indulgent, or judicious reader, (by
whichever title you may please to be addressed,) when you discover
that the heroes of the Coffee Club, invested by your scrutinizing sagacity
with so many fictitious attributes, whether of honor or of
dishonor, are in truth but cognate atoms with yourself in making up
the mass of our small and secluded community. Nor will your self-satisfaction
be at all enhanced, by the remembrance of the astute
conjectures, ‘positive certainties,’ ‘perfect convictions,’ and ‘confidential
informations,’ which have afforded you matter of exultation
for a season, but are, by the revealment of the truth, shown to be unfounded,
and if cherished with vanity, ridiculous. Each, however,
may soothe his chagrin, with the assurance that no one was wiser
than himself, and that the secret, which baffled his endeavors, not
even the talismanic power of woman’s curiosity could elicit.</p>

<p>It is the eve of the farewell exercises of the class, and the last
meeting of the Coffee Club. Tristo had thrown gloom upon our
spirits, by a mournful <i>epitaph</i> upon the pleasures and the duties,

<p>and puns and quips unceasing shot through their obscurity, like
lightning through a cloud, seemed at first to be in no mood for the
pathetic, or the serious. Pulito, too, after a brief and apparently
regretful abstraction, broke forth in a strain half querulous, half
laughing.</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Well, ‘gentlemen commoners,’ however discourteous
the remark may appear to you and your society, I must ne’ertheless
regret that I am not this evening where I might have been,
in a certain far-famed street, and gazing upon a certain lovely face,

<p><i>Apple.</i> “No, indeed I have not; I was afraid I should though,
and did not give her a chance. I was acquainted with some of them
once, and endeavored to patronize, instruct, and even please them.
But they had neither the acuteness to perceive the point of my
puns, nor the complaisance to laugh at them, even when I led the
way. In fact&mdash;the fiends scorch their pictures!&mdash;I believe they
laughed <i>at</i> instead of <i>with</i> me. ‘Flattery is nectar and ambrosia to

can fellows walk over all creation for fine prospects&mdash;my best prospect,
as a kindred spirit once said, is the prospect of a good dinner.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Surely, the view from East Rock is delightful.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Undoubtedly, if there be two or three mountain nymphs
hanging affectionately on your arm. Oh! triple horror! To toil
through two long miles of dusty barrenness, and crawl <i>a la quadrupede</i>
up a mountain of shifting sand and triturated stones, to view a
few houses included between shoal water and furze hills.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Methinks only a few weeks since, <i>you</i> escorted thither
some twelve or thirteen of these same mountain nymphs.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “To be sure I did, and therefore I can speak from experience.
But it argues an unkind disposition in you, to fling a man’s
errors and misfortunes in his teeth. I did perpetrate that act, and
as I hope forgiveness, I am contrite therefor. We set off one morning,
when it was so hot that the very clouds <i>smoked</i>, though <i>I</i> could
not&mdash;for what would Jonathan Oldbuck’s ‘<i>woman-kind</i>’ say? ‘The
ladies be upon thee, Sampson,’ thought I. I could not laugh, though
there was enough that was ridiculous, for I had corns. So I went
sweating along under a load of milk-and-water refreshments, like a
man carrying his own gibbet. I climbed up the hill like another
Sisyphus, with a train of Sirens behind me. When there what saw
we. Why, through a cracked spy-glass, I saw <i>Nescio Quod</i> here,
my own chum, coming out the bookstore&mdash;wonderful, thrilling, soul-stirring
prospect! Then, lo! we had left the pine-apples a quarter
of a mile from the foot of the mountain, where we had stopped to
browse. Nothing would do&mdash;one lady was faint, and must have a
little pine-apple juice&mdash;another sweet nymph, in an unguarded moment,
said that her principal object in coming, was the pleasure of
eating the pine-apples&mdash;and another rosy-cheeked, and not very
sylph-like figure, remarked, that if Mr. Dumpling would be so good
as to go after the basket, he should have the pleasure of her arm
down the mountain. The devil of a pleasure, thought I; the sweet
creature must have ‘gane daft, clean daft,’ or she would never have
offered such an inducement&mdash;better for me ‘that a millstone were
hanged about my neck,’ &amp;c.&mdash;but down I must come, and down I
came, and when I got down, I stayed down. I ate the pine-apples
myself, and laid down under the shade till evening, when I slunk
home, leaving the ladies to their other beaux. I had some excuse
though, for, while ‘midway between heaven and earth,’ I stumbled
over a sweet-brier, and wrenched my ankle so excruciatingly, that
Pope’s line occurred to my mind with some solemnity&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Die of a <i>rose</i> in aromatic (<i>a rheumatic</i>) pain.’</p>
</div>

<p>You take, do you? I managed, however, to reset the <i>luxed</i> but by
no means <i>luxurious</i> joint, and grateful for my escape, I have forsworn
the ladies, and pray for grace to keep my vow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>The laughter, long and loud, that succeeded the story of Apple’s
tribulations, was a sort of clearing-up shower, and left the moral atmosphere
in a temper more consonant with the seriousness of the
hour. After a short breathing-space, the conversation broke forth
anew, and in an entirely different channel. The sad peculiarity of
our situation gave to our views, and possibly to our remarks, a tinge
of bitterness and satire.</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Well, fellows, ‘our course is run, our errand done’
within these walls, and we are to leave them for ever&mdash;and why not
bid farewell with a light heart and bounding hopes. To be sure, the
vexings of the world will be rather uncomfortable. A gentlemanly
air, and a languid intimacy with the ‘tricksy pomp’ of literature, will
not make a man a President or a <i>millionaire</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “The prospect is somewhat discouraging. I should have
felt no misgivings at starting in the literary world a century ago,
when the noble art of punning was duly appreciated and rewarded,
as witness the celebrity of that great man, Dean Swift. Or I could
have been content to have ruffled it with the quibbling, conceit-loving
cavaliers, who basked in the smiles of Queen Bess. But
now the principles of taste are sadly perverted, and this noble art,
this sole distinctive mark of genius, has sought and found refuge
only beneath the classic shades of College. It is truly sad to me,
to think of leaving this last strong hold of wit and sentiment.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Why, Apple, your grief bewilders your mind. You
began with talking about <i>punning</i>, and ended with wit and sentiment.
Where is the connection?”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “At least as close, Mr. Quod, as between your real and
expressed opinion, when you speak so despitefully of this innocent
and dignified amusement. But now we are on the subject, what is
wit?”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “To which question I might reply, as Democritus did to
him that asked the definition of a man&mdash;‘<i>tis that which we all see
and know</i>.’ Such is the language of Barrow, the celebrated divine;
I read it this very day. I however would admit no definition, that
could possibly include a <i>pun</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “You go to an extreme there, Nescio. A mere play
upon words, a mere coincidence of sounds, makes but a poor jest,
and a ready facility in discovering and thrusting into conversation
these ‘imperfect sympathies,’ gives one but slight pretensions to the
reputation of a wit. But there are some witticisms, which depend
for their force upon a <i>pun</i>, but yet including also a racy humor,
deserve the praise of true wit. I will read you an instance from
Hazlitt:&mdash;“An idle fellow, who had only fourpence left in the
world, which had been put by to pay for the baking of some meat
for his dinner, went and laid it out to buy a new string for a guitar.
An old acquaintance, on hearing this story, repeated these lines out
of L’Allegro&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘And ever against <i>eating</i> cares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lap me in soft Lydian airs.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the point of the jest lies in the pun upon <i>eating</i>, yet who
does not acknowledge it as highly humorous. There are not many
puns so refined and pure as this, but they sink in infinite and imperceptible
gradations. You cannot draw a bold line between ‘the wit
of words and wit of things.’ ‘For,’ as is said of Wit and Madness,
‘thin partitions do their bounds divide.’”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Very true, and I detest that squeamishness, which
would refuse the praise of wit to any thing approaching to a pun,
and sympathize most heartily with poor Apple for his many rebuffs.
But nevertheless, Apple, ‘a joke’s prosperity lies in the ear of the
hearer,’ Shakspeare says, and one should not complain if his pet
witticisms are not received with applause and answered with laughter.
If the jest is worthless, he deserves ridicule&mdash;if it does contain
the essence of wit he has only himself to blame for giving it an
utterance, where it could not be appreciated. Think you that Addison
would have displayed his delicate humor for the amusement of
crabbed and adust bookworms, or Voltaire sported his sarcasms to
tickle the ear of clowns? Let their example encourage and instruct
you, my dear Apple, and if you cannot equal their fame, you
may, at least, attain the celebrity of Joe Miller.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “You will allow, however, Pulito, there is too often
manifested a disposition to decry and disparage, when approbation
would have been more natural. Censure is too often heard from
lips, from which praise would have been more graceful, or silence
more becoming. There are too many among us, who seek to rise
upon the fall of their rivals&mdash;too many ‘frosty-spirited knaves,’ of
whom it may be said, in bitterest truth, ‘not to admire is all the art
they know.’”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “I have, however, been accustomed to regard such characters
with more of pity than severity. I have regarded them as
defrauded by nature of the just proportions of humanity. I have
been vexed by their perversity, but no more inclined to resent it,
than to chastise the ceaseless annoyances of a child or an idiot.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “You underrate their <i>intellect</i>, that you may relieve
their <i>heart</i> from the imputation of baseness. True, he who is always
searching for faults, without paying any attention to beauties,
affords strong grounds for the conclusion, that he has no perception
of the latter, and in his own experience is conversant only with the
former: and he who is ever detecting plagiarisms, and starting resemblances,
gives reason for the suspicion, that his acquaintance
with the fountains of these stolen waters, is not so purely accidental,
or so honorably gotten, as he would have us imagine. But deficiency
of taste and weakness of mind are not the sole causes of
such conduct. The <i>prompter</i> of the whole is envy,&mdash;envy, the
meanest passion of the human heart&mdash;the only one in which there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
is not some shade of honor, some trace of nobility. Ambition may
be laudable&mdash;hate become a virtue from the loathsomeness of its object&mdash;covetousness
acquire dignity from the excellence of the thing
coveted&mdash;but the baseness of <i>envy</i> is enhanced by the purity and
splendor against which it is directed.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Not only is envy so mean a passion in itself, but it exerts
a most debasing influence upon the intellect and whole character.
Indeed, if we may believe Coleridge, the cherishing of it is
incompatible with the existence of genius. His language is solemn;
would that all the fosterers, or rather the <i>victims</i>, of this worst vice,
to which we are by our situation exposed, might listen to his warning.
‘Genius may co-exist with wildness, idleness, folly, even with
crime; but not long, believe me, with the indulgence of an envious
disposition. Envy is both the worst and justest divinity, as I once
saw it expressed somewhere in a page of Stobæus; it dwarfs and
withers its worshippers.’”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “To recall your attention, Tristo, to the subject from
which we passed so suddenly to a more serious one, what think you
of those who ‘wit-wanton it’ with things sacred, who at every breath
break over the bounds of modesty, and outrage our sympathies with
the true and the beautiful, for the sake of a momentary, and not unfrequently
a shame-faced laugh?”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Such persons do themselves and others more injury
than they think. Their incessant insults to all refinement and delicacy
of feeling, if unresented and unguarded against, at length deaden
and efface these sentiments. Bulwer says well of such, ‘Their humor
debauches the whole moral system&mdash;they are like the Sardinian
herb&mdash;they make you laugh, it is true, but they <i>poison you in the
act</i>.’”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “It is disgraceful that impurity should be an unequivocal
characteristic of college wit. But it will be so, until some one shall
demonstrate by his own example that there is no necessary connection,
but rather an essential hostility between real humor and obscenity.
But so long as it is easier to swim with the current than to
buffet its dashings&mdash;so long as it is pleasanter to excite a hearty
laugh, than encounter a cold sneer&mdash;so long as indolence and vacillation
continue to be <i>descriptive marks</i> of a student’s character&mdash;we
need not hope for a change.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Whoever would attempt to effect one, should remember
the aphorism, ‘He ought to be well mounted who is for leaping
over the hedges of custom.’”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “If this license on the part of some deserves severe reprobation,
the chilling churlishness of those, who can feel no sympathy
with <i>pleasure</i>, be it ever so innocent&mdash;whose minds can admit
but the single idea of the <i>useful</i>, and reject as trifling the elegant
and refining&mdash;who, swallowed up in their admiration of moral beauty,
lose sight of or depreciate intellectual symmetry, (forgetting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
moral excellence, though it resemble in its value the priceless diamond,
is not like it advantaged by a dull and roughened setting)&mdash;such,
I say, must not pass without their share of censure, for they
are in no slight degree the occasion, I will not say the cause, of the
opposite vice in others.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Such illiberality frustrates the praise-worthy exertions
of all who indulge in it. It places them out of the circle of influence&mdash;their
efforts can no more reach those whom they desire to affect,
than (to use a magniloquent simile) the perturbations of the
moons of Uranus can sway the Earth’s satellite in its orbit. But
beside the unfortunate reaction of such principles, is not this cutting
off, ‘at one fell swoop,’ all amusements, this tying down to one
staid rule of <i>formal observance</i>, youth of every variety of taste, talent
and temperament, and brought up under every complexion of
circumstances&mdash;this curbing of all tastes and inclinations, not within
the <i>lawgiver’s</i> capabilities&mdash;is it not based upon error of judgment,
and directed by something of inquisitorial arrogance?”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “I never listen to a specimen of such frosty philosophy,
without recalling an anecdote, much to the point. It is found, originally,
I believe, in one of Pope’s letters to Swift, though I read it
somewhere else. ‘A courtier saw a sage picking out the best dishes
at table. ‘How,’ said he, ‘are sages epicures?’ ‘Do you think,
Sir,’ said the wise man, reaching over the table to help himself, ‘do
you think, Sir, that God Almighty made all the good things of this
world for fools?’”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “The sage must have belonged to the sect <i>Deipnosophoi</i>,
or ‘Supper-wise,’ whom D’Israeli mentions. His principles,
however, will apply in their full extent, I think, to the purer pleasures
of taste and wit and literature.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Talk not to them of the ‘purer pleasures of taste, and
wit, and literature,’ for these are their utter abomination&mdash;snares for
the youthful mind&mdash;idle perversions of talent. Speak to them of
the grand display of moral power in Shakspeare’s dramas, and for
an unanswerable answer, they will point to a gross expression&mdash;and
consistently enough too, for theirs is the morality of <i>words</i>. They
cannot perceive that the <i>scope</i> of all his principal plays is purely
and symmetrically moral, or even religious&mdash;that they seldom violate
the modesty of nature, though they may overstep the prudishness
of an age when, ‘<i>La pudeur s’est enfuie des cœurs, et s’est refugiée
sur les lévres.</i>’&mdash;Modesty has fled from the heart, and taken
refuge on the lips. They cannot admire the <i>overruling providence</i>,
by which his untutored genius, apparently so wild and uncontrollable,
has been unerringly directed to conformity with truth and virtue.
In their esteem the pious Cowper would have been more
worthy, had he devoted his talents to the <i>practical</i> duties of ‘the
clerk of the Commons,’ rather than have <i>wasted</i> them in the unproductive
pursuits of poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, let them enjoy their opinions, provided they do
not meddle with others in the gratification of their taste, or profess
to judge in matters which they so virulently decry. The nightingale
may not quarrel with the discordant braying of the ass, till the
‘long-eared’ either attempt to ‘discourse sweet sounds’ himself, or
criticise the melody of others.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “‘Aye, there’s the rub!’ None are more prompt in criticising,
none more forward to condemn, than these same individuals.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Nothing ruffles the placidity of my temper so much,
and so frequently, as the confidence with which some fellows, whose
ignorance is absolute, pass judgment upon works of literature and
taste. There are those, who cannot tell for their lives whether
Walter Scott wrote Waverly or the Commentaries, or whether the
author of Hudibras, the Reminiscences, and the Analogy, be not
one and the same, who yet issue their unblushing firman upon any
stray volume of poetry or romance, they may have chanced to pick
up and gape through. I heard one, who could not count beyond
ten, declare solemnly that he had no opinion of James, or Bulwer,
and that J. K. Paulding could write better than either. Another,
who had never seen a book, save the Family Bible, before he came
to College, averred that Sterne, Smollett, Fielding, and Richardson
united, never wrote any thing fit to be read by a man of good morals,
or sound sense; and thought, moreover, that <i>Campbell’s</i> Thanatopsis
was far inferior to <i>Bryant’s</i> Pleasures of Hope! And still
another affirmed that the plays of Shakspeare even, were ruinous to
the interests of morality, and that all the other dramatists of England
ought to be buried under the ruins of the stage they support.
Upon sifting the fellow, however, I found he had never read a play,
saving the Tempest, Comedy of Errors, and a couple of diluted operas
in the London stage!”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “And yet these are they, who sit in daily judgment upon
what they have neither the sense to comprehend, nor the delicacy
to appreciate. These are they, who stigmatize every thing beautiful
as a <i>rush</i>, and all that is novel to their narrow knowledge, as extravagant
and wild. ’Tis a Bœotian criticising the dialect of Athens;
a Scythian carping at the figures of Praxiteles. Shall the home-bred
rustic, who thinks the middle of the sky directly above his
head, and supposes that a walk of a day would bring his feet to the
‘blue concave,’ attempt to teach the life-long traveller the principles
of society, and decide upon the manners and customs and wonders
of the world? And yet it would be as reasonable to the full
as the conduct of him, who, when his knowledge is confined to <i>particulars</i>,
attempts to play the critic&mdash;a part, which, in its very nature,
implies <i>generalization</i> of the widest kind.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “How can the poor catechumen, who has not yet donned
the robes of his novitiate, nor raised his eyes to the vestibule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
much less stood in his sacrificial garments by the High Altar in the
Temple of the Muses, presume to decide upon the value and lustre
of the treasures its <i>adyta</i> conceal? It is as if the puny whipster,
who fumes and gesticulates upon the academic stage, and whose
thoughts and language are ‘a combination of disjointed things,’
should attempt to span or analyze the harmonious vastness and
sweeping magnificence of an Edmund Burke.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “There is likewise a species of grave wiseacres&mdash;sober
fools, who are quite as senseless and less amusing than fools of the
more fantastic turn. They think that wisdom dwells only upon
sealed lips, and that strength of mind and sobriety of purpose, is <i>evidenced</i>
by nothing but a rueful face. These fellows (to use the
old Greek phrase) ‘lift the eyebrows’ with a dull forthshowing of
meditative wisdom, and a countenance</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “There are here, likewise, even as every where, many
who can stop at no medium, but carry reasonable freedom to unwarrantable
license. Because it is both pleasant and right to spend
some time in general, and above all, in female society, some therefore,
in their society fling away all their time, and, with their time,
fling away character, and knowledge, and happiness, and worth.
Because it is not well to be always bending over the learning of the
present, and listening to the eloquence of the past, some therefore,
double, wheel, march, and countermarch through these dusty
streets during the long hours of a summer’s day, and when they
catch a glimpse at the shadow of a female form, they experience a
momentary heaven. Others, remembering that it is irrational to crucify
the senses, and mortify the flesh, smoke, eat, and sleep, continually.
Others, hearing that as well profit as delight may be reaped
from the inspection of fancy’s fairy finger-work, are on the tiptoe of
panting expectation for each miserable novel that falls lifeless from
the press. And thus it was, thus it is, thus it will be.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “But idleness&mdash;idleness is the student’s bane. It is astounding
how we throw away our time, and our best time&mdash;our
spring-hour of life. Time is the medium of acquisition, and, losing
<i>that</i>, we lose all. I am no Utopian in theory, nor visionary in practice:
neither am I free from the follies I deplore. But the strides
which <i>might</i> be made in our collegiate course, would be mighty and
amazing.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I agree with you. Every ordinary mind, by more judicious
application, might accomplish double what it does. I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
not mean that just twice as much would be read, or acquired; but
that the <i>mind</i> would be twice as far advanced. It would not only
have received twice the strength, and twice the beauty, from the
studies it had actually traversed, but would be doubly fitted to grasp,
conquer, and improve whatever might afterwards occur. The progress
of the mind is in geometrical ratio. Every new and liberal
idea, that is gained by a boy of twelve, is a capital which will return
with yearly and enormous interest. It is analogous to the gaining of
worldly wealth, where you must <i>hew</i> your slow and narrow path
from nothing to competence; but from competence to opulence, the
road is broad and easy.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “I cannot divine the <i>modality</i> (as the schoolmen might
say) of some minds&mdash;the manner, in which they operate. For I
know of those, who for four years have toiled with desperate firmness,
and are what they were. They seem to have pursued a mill-horse
track, without the remotest conception that there was aught
else of value in the universe beside. Now I complain not of the
rigor or of the nature of our course. Stern application is our only
hope, and the course of authors we peruse, is perhaps as good as
could be devised; but it is the <i>spirit</i> with which they study. They
consider what they here gain, not as a <i>mean</i>, but as an <i>end</i>. Every
man, who would be ‘aut Cæsar, aut nullus,’ and whose eye goes
forward to the ‘immensum infinitumque’ of Tully, <i>must generalize</i>&mdash;<i>must</i>
view things <i>relatively</i>&mdash;<i>must</i> consider every thing, not as a
whole, but as a part. If one possess this generalizing spirit, I care
not how undivided be his attention to the college course; for I believe
that there is in the books of the first three years, beauty and
grandeur and weight, sufficient to justify, nay <i>demand</i>, almost <i>entire</i>
attention. For instance, to gain a perfect intimacy with Horace&mdash;not
an intimacy with his words merely, and sentiments&mdash;but an intimacy
with his beauties&mdash;with his <i>soul</i>&mdash;would require one month of
the severest study; and yet such an intimacy is requisite to justify
studying him at all: for if he is not to be appreciated&mdash;if that evaporating
something, wherein he differs so widely from a dull Latin
proser, is not to be seen and felt&mdash;you might as well have been reading
Cato upon gardening, or Vitruvius upon architecture. But
these fellows in studying a foreign tongue, give the general sense in
hap-hazard English, without gaining any insight into the philosophy
of mind, or the theory of language.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “I think, moreover, that we ought to be more conversant
with the sciences. Some of the details may, perhaps, be superfluous;
but surely no one can claim to be a liberally-educated <i>gentleman</i>,
without a general acquaintance with all, and a perfect knowledge
of some of those departments. Whatever may have been my
former obliquities, or short-comings in these studies, I am determined
to retrieve them all. I have begun with attempting to square the
circle, upon which great problem I have employed two weeks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Ha! Ha! do you approach the goal!”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “I cannot say that I do very rapidly; but I feel increased
acuteness of perception. I think I might discover this grand secret,
could I hit upon some method of reducing the circle to linear measurement.
My nearest approximation is to make a circle of a string,
and then quadrate its sides by the introvention of a square surface
of board. Of course, I have the perimeter and square contents of
the board, and if I could fit the latter accurately to the string, the
work is done, and I am Apple the Great. But ‘hic labor, hoc
opus est.’”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Ha! Ha! Be not wearied in well doing, Dumpling;
you have opened on the right scent, (<i>erige aures, atque dirige gressus</i>.)”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “But there is a more serious view to be taken of this
matter, and one to which we must all open our eyes sooner or later,
and well will it be for us if we take counsel while the storm is yet
lowering, rather than look back with despairing, remorseful eye when
ruin is in the retrospect. The day will come when he, who has
squandered his abilities, and perverted his passions, will ‘begin to
be in want,’ when mortified pride and conscious inferiority will
‘bite like a serpent, and sting like an adder’&mdash;a day, when the
busy idleness, the trifling engagements, and the languid excuses,
which now lull all suspicion of an <i>actual waste</i> of time, will be forgotten,
and nothing but the results will be visible. Then, one hasty,
reverted glance, without any minute calculation, will inform us, that
by our thriftless expenditure, when we might have economized to
some purpose, we are <i>compelled</i> to be idle and insignificant; when
we <i>feel</i> idleness to be a <i>disgrace</i>, and insignificance a <i>torment</i>. And
why are not we alive to all this? Why do we not feel it, and <i>show</i>
that we feel it, by our actions, when we can thus in theorizing, ‘put
on the spectacles of age?’ The melancholy maxim of the ancients
explains it&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_REASON_OF_ANIMALS_NOT_THE_REASON_OF_MAN">THE REASON OF ANIMALS NOT THE REASON OF MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p>The organic kingdom seems to be little else than a system of
means, resisting for a short period only the laws which govern inanimate
matter, and then yielding to their power. Wherever the contemplative
mind turns among the innumerable tribes of animals,
which have been revealed by the scrutiny of man, it beholds them
all struggling a little while for a sentient existence, and then sinking
down, to form a part of that mingled mass, which has given them,
and continues to give their successors, sustenance. It is not however
animated matter only which thus for a moment attracts, and
then passes from our observation. In each individual of all this
numberless multitude, we behold the glimmering of intelligence, and
in some species it seems to fall but little below the uncultivated reason
of man; nay more, in their architecture, in their fabrics, in their
modes of subsistence and defence, many are known to rival the utmost
stretch of human ingenuity. This intelligence also, and this
ingenuity, vanishes from before us. The theory has indeed been
formed, that this appearance of reason, wherever found, or however
feeble, is but the commencement of an immortal existence; but
it is not thus that the mass of mankind view the subject. They are
accustomed to look upon the whole animal kingdom as progressing
to a period, when, not only the sensations of their bodies will cease,
and their organs be left, without exception, to decay, but when all
their intelligence and skill also will be swallowed up in annihilation.
If then the reason of brutes is the reason of man, how strong, how
complete the analogy, and how natural the conclusion, that the
mind of man too, with the decease of his body ceases to exist! Living
therefore as the most intelligent of these animals do, in the midst
of us, and seeming to think and reason every day as really as ourselves,
reason itself seems to be constantly persuading us that our
end is the same. Indeed, if man differs from the brute only in the
degree of intellect which he possesses, it is almost demonstrably certain,
that annihilation or immortality alike await us. That animals
are immortal, however, it is impossible to believe; for if this may
be predicated of one individual, it may be predicated of every species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
in which animal life can be proved to exist. From the highest
intelligence which exists among them, to the meanest insect that
crawls in the dust, or the dullest inhabitant of a shell that clings to a
rock, there is not a point where the line of separation can, with any
degree of plausibility, be drawn, and we might almost extend the
chain to the plant that shrinks from the touch, and the flower that
follows the sun. This theory therefore we reject as unnatural and
absurd. Hence we are reduced to the necessity of allowing, either
that man is not immortal, or that his reason is different, not only in
degree, but in its nature, from that of brutes. Although if the latter
be true, it does not follow that the former is false, yet one of the
most powerful arguments in support of it falls to the ground, and
leaves other evidence to produce a conviction of the truth of its opposite.
It is then an object of no little importance to discover, if
possible, whether there is sufficient difference between the faculties
of men and animals, to justify the conclusion that their destinies are
so different.</p>

<p>In endeavoring to accomplish this object, we propose to consider
brutes, in the first place, as they exist in their natural state, and afterwards,
as they are when trained by man. Let us go, then, to the
forest where the bird sits upon her nest, and the beast rests in his
lair in undisturbed repose&mdash;or rather, if you please, where air, earth
and water, teem with countless multitudes, all alive with activity,
and all closely devoted to the peculiar employments for which Nature
has fitted them. Compare now this busy scene, with that
where the same elements groan under the burden imposed upon
them by man, in his highest state of cultivation. Mark the aerial
artist as she proceeds in the construction of her edifice, which in its
execution and adaptation to its situation, defies all imitation by man.
Without a model, and without instruction or experience, she fabricates
a nest, which, in materials and construction, as near as circumstances
permit, resembles those of all her predecessors. Where
there is no possibility of a communication, precisely the same process
is followed, and the same result is produced in every instance.
Neither does age, observation or experience, produce the least improvement,
but it more frequently happens, that the first product of
this instinctive skill excels all that succeed. The same appears to
be true of every species of the brute creation as we find them in the
wilds of nature. All come into existence endowed with a species
of intellect; a practical ingenuity, apparently far superior to any
thing which man possesses, previous to observation.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the mental endowments of brutes are to be estimated
by the readiness with which they arrive at certain practical results,
man sinks below them. Among the whole human race, we find not
a single instance of such instinctive knowledge. Man springs into
existence of all animals the most helpless, and the most ignorant of
the means of his support or his happiness. He is compelled to
learn and direct every step of his course by observation and experience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
He is left to deliberate and choose without any previous bias
of the mind, and hence arises that vast diversity of manners and customs,
scarcely greater between the most civilized and the most barbarous
people, than between those who are buried in an equal
depth of barbarism. On the other hand, throughout each particular
species of the brute creation, all appear to be guided by one mind,
and urged on by some irresistible power to the same definite ends.
In the state in which we are now considering them, there is no variation
in their habitudes, and seems to be no possibility of their
choosing a different course from that so universally pursued. It is
as natural to them as to live; as involuntary as their breath. This
is instinct&mdash;a faculty to man denied&mdash;a pilot whose absence leaves
him to the winds and waves of circumstances, while its presence impels
as well as guides the animal creation in all their intricate manœvres.</p>

<p>There are traits, however, in which man and the most intelligent
of other animals closely resemble each other. Present, for instance,
a pleasing object to the eye of man, and the countenance will involuntarily
kindle into a smile. Present to the half-famished wanderer
an article of food, and the flowing saliva and the beseeching look,
will testify, in spite of him, his eagerness to receive it. Tear from
the fond mother her darling offspring, and plunge into its unprotected
breast the glittering steel, and an agony unutterable will give her
wings to fly to its rescue, and a thousand tongues to call for aid, or
drive her to madness with despair.</p>

<p>This is a species of action, exhibited to an actual extent, perhaps,
though in different ways, by both animals and men. It evinces a
power which it is not in the nature of man wholly to resist, and under
the full operation of which we use neither deliberation nor judgment.
Such seems to be the power which gives rise to a large part
of the actions of the most intelligent animals. It differs little in its
nature from that instinct which guides them in their mechanical labors,
and, in connection with it, is sufficient to account for all the phenomena
which, as sentient beings, in their natural state, they exhibit
to us. It is the influence of the passions&mdash;the feelings&mdash;the heart.
In brutes, apart from instinct, (if this be not considered instinct,) it
holds universal sway. The objects which excite the passions, and
give rise to action, may not, indeed, in all cases be present. They
may be called up by circumstances in all the vividness of reality,
through the powerful memory with which brutes are endowed, yet
the motives of the action are the same as if the real object supplied
the place of the imaginary one. The principle is the same, and the
result is still produced by the influence of the animal feelings, excited
by sensible objects. But in man there is displayed a moving
power which exists independently of instinct, of love, or hate, or
hope, or fear, and which is capable of exercising a control over all,
unless it be the very strongest of human passions. In the exercise of
it, the passions are, as it were for the moment annihilated, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
intellect rises into a sphere where all tangible, sensible objects, vanish,
and the mind converses with objects beyond the reach of mere
animal perception.</p>

<p>The question may now arise, how are we to account for all that
variety of movement and action, which animals acquire under the
instruction of man? If instinct and passion are the only influences
to which they are subject, we should reasonably suppose that their
actions would be as invariable as the motives from which they originate.
Had they never been subject to a higher order of beings,
this would be found universally true. But that class of animals
which we denominate domestic, and indeed almost all upon which
the hand of man has laid its controlling influence, exhibit a species
of action, which indicates a capability of improvement, and for which
it would be impossible to account upon the principles which have
been considered. There is another principle which is seen alike in
animals and man, and might with propriety be denominated an artificial
instinct. It is habit&mdash;a state in which we are led to act with
reference to definite ends, and yet act involuntarily. By a frequent
repetition of some motion of the hand, the foot or the whole person,
we come at last to do the same unconsciously, and it is by this means
that we perform so readily many of the intricate processes which
the arts require. It is this which explains the secret of attachment
to places and things. Even the prisoner, after a long-continued
confinement to a gloomy cell, finds, at his departure, a magic
charm binding him to the dreary habitation. The tender threads of
affection have become entwined around the objects so constantly before
him, and he is obliged to summon his reason, to break through
the silvery web that is formed around his heart. Observation teaches
us that animals are subject to the same influence. After a period
of confinement and familiarity with man, the door of their enclosure
may be opened, and almost without exception, they will leave it,
only to return again of their own accord&mdash;not because a judgment
teaches them that such a condition is preferable, but because a new
influence is thrown over them which they cannot shake off. It is
obviously upon this principle that they perform all the manœvres,
and answer all the purposes, which they are made to do by man.</p>

<p>These three causes&mdash;instinct, passion, and habit, are believed to
be sufficient to account for all the varieties of action exhibited by
animals. We no where discover any of that power of origination,
that freedom of thought and action, which renders man capable of
endless improvement, and worthy of presiding over the brute creation.
Nor any where do we find that power of abstraction, by
which, from evidences of design which are displayed among terrestrial
and celestial objects, we are able to reason our way up to an
Infinite Being whom we have neither seen nor heard. These are
the characteristics of man, which render him an accountable being&mdash;give
him a conscience, and stamp him with the impress of immortality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_WILLIS">MR. WILLIS.</h2>
</div>

<p>When so many mouths are full of Mr. Willis, and pamphlets and
periodicals are alternately lauding and lashing him&mdash;and, moreover,
since he has so lately passed through this city, (the city of his Alma
Mater,) and with him, his very lovely trans-Atlantic lady&mdash;it is certainly
proper that this magazine (the deputed organ of Yale’s literary
notions) break its dignified silence. Criticism, it is true, of
right belongs to older heads&mdash;but since such numbers have apparently
forgotten this in the community at large, we shield our presumption
under their greater impertinence. Impertinence! That
the thousand and one notions put forth here and there to the detriment
of Willis, are impertinent, lies on the face of them. What
right have they to find fault with his coat, or the fit of his breeches?
“Ah! but he don’t pay for them!” Prove that, rascal&mdash;perhaps
your prejudice then will be less apparent. But stop a moment.</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;we are not seated to make out an analysis of Willis’
mind&mdash;nor to criticise thoroughly his poetry&mdash;nor to meddle particularly
with his morals&mdash;nor to read him furiously a Chesterfieldian
lecture&mdash;nor to tell him whether he shall or shall not curl his hair&mdash;whether
he shall or shall not have his carriage, his horses, his dogs,
<i>et cetera, et cetera</i>. No! nothing of this, save incidentally&mdash;we
leave this to others. Besides, ’tis too late for it&mdash;they have been
treated on, and his new work has not yet come to us. But our purpose
is, to scribble a rapid, running, off-hand article&mdash;to trouble,
somewhat, some of the defamers of Willis&mdash;to give our own opinions
as may be about this or that&mdash;to say just what we have a mind
to&mdash;to say it how we have a mind to&mdash;and (of this, reader, be certain)
to enjoy our own opinions.</p>

<p>Whether we are capable of this, of advancing an opinion&mdash;of that,
reader, you must judge. Thus much we <i>dare</i> say&mdash;our prejudices
will not trouble our judgment. We have alike objected to the indiscriminate
laudatory efforts of the friends of Willis, and the pitiable
swellings and puny malice of his enemies&mdash;we have made ourselves
alike familiar with his prose and with his poetry&mdash;(what man of taste
has not?)&mdash;we have never shut our eyes on his faults, or suffered a
jaundiced vision to distort, discolor, or otherwise interfere with his excellencies&mdash;we
have often censured and praised him&mdash;fought for
him and against him&mdash;in short, been placed exactly in those circumstances,
which are favorable to a proper appreciation of his
merits&mdash;supposing all this time, that we possess a moderately good
share of judgment in these matters. Thus much we dare say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>The most troublesome things to be met with now-a-days, are
your <i>echoing</i> gentlemen.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Mr. Willis has done thus and so, says
one&mdash;Mr. Willis has written thus and so, says another. Now we
don’t say Mr. Willis has <i>not</i> done or written thus and so&mdash;perhaps
he has&mdash;nor would we be understood exactly in this free government,
as interdicting the expression of opinions, even supposing
these young gentlemen harmless, and as entirely innocent of a capability
to judge as they really are&mdash;but we do say that, in this hot
weather, and especially as dog days are coming on, every buzzing,
barking, or otherwise troublesome creature, should be heard as little
as possible, and that it is altogether too much of a tax upon the
easiness of modest men, and too much of a tax on the patience of
sensible ones, when with all their exertions and cooling appliances,
(such as ventilating, dressing thin, and going under the College
pump,) they can scarcely keep themselves comfortable. He’s a
puppy, says one. What do you mean by “puppy,” say we. Why,
he’s an exquisite&mdash;a dandy. Now, hang your ignorance! for your
charge proves you a clown. <i>We</i> have seen Mr. Willis (we have no
acquaintance with him) sitting and standing&mdash;we have seen him in
company and out of company&mdash;we have seen him hat on and hat
off&mdash;we have seen him walking and talking&mdash;and <i>we</i> declare, that
there’s nothing about him but an air of high society, and a well bred
gentleman. The charge of being a dandy, might be laid any where
with equal propriety&mdash;the urbanity of his deportment, considering
his publicity, is worthy of high praise.</p>

<p>His publicity, his English reputation&mdash;this is another thing his
enemies turn against him. Witness the slighting method of the
Quarterly&mdash;witness the cool handling of the Edinburgh&mdash;witness
his annihilation in the Metropolitan, say they. Annihilation! murder&mdash;what
a term is this&mdash;here’s a tax&mdash;here’s a sweep&mdash;here’s a
pull on our credulousness. Have these gentlemen forgotten the
admitted principle in physics, that you cannot annihilate matter?
But&mdash;’tis of a piece with the rest of their absurdities.</p>

<p>As for the attacks of those great organs of English sentiment, the
Edinburgh and Quarterly, it only needs a glance at the <i>acknowledged</i>
reason of those attacks, to show it altogether complimentary
to the <i>talents</i> of Willis. His stories publishing successively in the
London New Monthly&mdash;he was bowed through England with an assiduity
and politeness well worthy the English nation, and of which
any American might be proud. The first ranks welcomed him to
their circles&mdash;their first literary men were pleased with his acquaintance,
(aye! the very men who afterwards smote at him)&mdash;and the
first critic of England, or of the world even (North, we mean,) has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
estimated his power, and written him&mdash;no common genius. This were
praise enough, in all conscience. The indiscretions of Willis&mdash;and
such he has, and we blame him&mdash;these it was called forth those
harrowing, ripping, raking articles, so eagerly cited against him now;
and with these <i>facts</i> before us&mdash;shall we take <i>their</i> estimate of his
intellect, and North on our side into the bargain? Out on him who
does it! But the first men of the age have been placed precisely
as Willis has&mdash;some of the Reviews one side, some on the other.
Byron was thus placed. To the last day of his life he was horridly
mauled by some of them, whenever that great lion turned flank and
exposed himself to the enemy. He has been called ridiculous, affected,
a narrow though great mind, and a plagiarist, by one of
their first Reviews; and others of their great men have run the gauntlet,
and after the same fashion. There’s nothing new in it&mdash;what,
then, is the worth of the argument?</p>

<p>Of the article in the Metropolitan, nothing need be said&mdash;’twas
personal <i>pique</i>, as every one knows. The fact that a single sentence
of Willis’ condemnatory of Marryatt called forth that article, is
a high proof of the estimation in which he was held, and speaking in
no ordinary tone. Policy should have kept Mr. Willis from saying
it&mdash;this no one doubts, whether it was true or not. If true, however,
he deserves less censure; and now we call upon every admirer
of Capt. Marryatt, and demand if it is not true, that there are passages
in most of his novels we read with disgust&mdash;that we would not
read in good society, or before a sister&mdash;and if he has not come into
a dangerous proximity with that point, where he deserves all that
Willis says of him? <i>We</i> assert that he has&mdash;let Capt. Marryatt’s
admirers disprove it. And the Willis and Marryatt correspondence
too! little need be said here, than that those letters went to show
Marryatt a bullying blackguard, and Willis <i>the</i> gentleman. These
things we assert&mdash;and yet professing ourselves admirers of Marryatt.
He is doubtless one of the geniuses of the age. But we will not let
our admiration distort facts, when such distortion is injurious to one
of our countrymen.</p>

<p>These echoing gentlemen talk much of Mr. Willis’ ephemeral
reputation&mdash;of his fame’s dying with him. Lo, and behold these
Solomons in literature&mdash;witness these wise men of Gotham,&mdash;these
“Daniels’ come to judgment!” Have these gentlemen to learn,
that men never tolerate each other’s weaknesses?&mdash;have they to
learn that Willis has been indiscreet?&mdash;have they to learn that
such numbers of young and old, high and low, rich and poor, as
have pitched upon him, have done so <i>for</i> this&mdash;and that it follows
necessarily, his genius is undervalued. Whether they have or not&mdash;men
of sense admit it all over the world. Men’s follies die with
them. We don’t bring hatred to the grave’s side&mdash;unless to throw
it in there and bury it. The smouldering earth we lay over them
hides their defects&mdash;we put their virtues in our hearts. So it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
with men whose follies tarnish their genius. Genius is in itself, a
living principle&mdash;you can’t annihilate it&mdash;you can’t lessen it&mdash;you
can’t depress it. You <i>may</i> undervalue it&mdash;you may rail at it&mdash;you
may affect to despise it. But it never was heard and it never will
be, that genius, however manifested, has not sooner or later regained
its splendid birth-right. So will it be with Willis&mdash;would we admit
what his enemies ask, that the community as a body are
against him. He has genius&mdash;a noble, lofty, and original one&mdash;(we
wish time permitted to show this by references)&mdash;his follies stand
betwixt the light and his merits&mdash;let him die, his follies die, and the
world at once acknowledges this merit. Such is the process&mdash;if we
admit, as just mentioned, that the community are against him.</p>

<p>We have already transcribed our limits&mdash;we therefore, pause.
Before doing so, however, let us and the reader understand each
other. Let us not be ranked with the mad admirers of Willis&mdash;we
are none such&mdash;he has too many follies for that. But we cannot
forget, either, how very very brilliant are many very many of his
productions, and with what unmitigated pleasure we have always perused
them. And, if our humble voice might be heard so far, we
would counsel Mr. Willis that he no longer&mdash;if he has done so&mdash;discredit
the fine genius that God has given him&mdash;that he tax well,
and long, and arduously, that mind of his&mdash;that he by some noble
effort so engrave his name on this age, that the rust of after years
shall never eat it away.</p>

</div>

<p>Civilization, among all the changes it has effected in the character
and habits of its subjects, has wrought none more remarkable
than that in the condition of woman. In savage countries, the degraded
slave of continual oppression&mdash;in barbarian nations, the dormant
medium of sensual felicity&mdash;among the semi-civilized, the ignorant
and secluded object of idol affection&mdash;it was reserved for the
refinement of a purer age to reinstate her by the side, and in the
heart of man. No longer his passive minister to pleasure, she has
risen to share with him the rights and the enjoyments of rational
existence. From the object of occasional devotion and general
contempt, she has become, in the world where her claims are acknowledged,
a guide-star of benign and sanctifying influence.&mdash;&mdash;Pish!
sentimentalizing, and on a subject trite as an almanac!&mdash;&mdash;But
why not? In my last number, as well my own assertions, as
the <i>inconsecutive</i> form of my conceptions, might have been proof convincing
that the solstitial airs had pervaded mind and body with their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
enervating breath. Since then, and while the sun was riding in his
more northern tropic, my energies fell before his potent presence
with a still lowlier prostration. Yet, as utter oppression will drive
even the weakest to resistance, so does trampled Nature rise rebellious
against the tyrant, and stand upright even before his summer-throne.
The cold airs of the morning send a vigorous life through
the limbs, which the toils of yesterday exhausted; and a <i>post-prandial</i>
siesta followed by a light repast “of meats and drinks, nature’s
refreshment sweet,” prepares the mind for an evening of quiet thought,
or rational enjoyment.</p>

<p>This morning is of the loveliest. Each gentle flower turns her fair
face to the god of her idolatry, and, like a grateful bride, repays the
warmth of his caresses with the perfume of her breath. It would
seem as if the wing of relenting Time had dropt a freshening essence
on his vassals, as he passed, and atoned, in the face of Nature and the
hearts of her children, for the ravages of years. ’Tis not the sacred
awe, that falls like a shadow from the stars of midnight, and wakes in
the soul an unutterable yearning for a holier home&mdash;’tis not the sad
solemnity of evening, that fuses into one pervading thought the
hopes of the future, and the sorrows of the past, whilst our gaze
follows far into his nightly pavilion the golden footsteps of the retreating
Day&mdash;’tis the freshness, that dwells in the pinion of the
eagle, when he springs from his dew-cold aerie in the mountains,
and soars, with eye turned direct and unblenching on the morning
sun. But to return to the women. It is a lamentable fact&mdash;‘horresco
referens’&mdash;that the old heathen, and the Greeks among them,
did not prize very highly these interesting objects. It is true that
the exquisite delicacy of female beauty, excited in their breasts a
natural thrill of pleasure, and now and then a Sappho or an Aspasia
by the united power of wit and loveliness threw a spell of enchantment
around the wisest, and bravest, and proudest of their
time. But these were exceptions. There is many a smart bit of
satire, and many a dull growl of defiance at the sex, scattered
through the pages of the Anthology&mdash;and these I have hitherto
neglected to translate, well knowing that the ladies are not so perfect
as to bear sarcasm with patience, and that a portion of their
anger might be diverted from the Greeks to me. Whether their
being created second entitles them to be considered <i>second-best</i>, it
is not my province to decide. At any rate I see not how we could
<i>get along</i> without them, and I am perfectly willing to add my experience
to that of Mungo Park, and testify that, where they are
suffered to have their own way, I have found them uniformly generous
and obliging.</p>

a Greek could mourn over the grave of a loved one, who had passed

<p>And now, dear reader, thou hast gathered with me a few of the
many wild-flowers, which bloom in the Anthology, but are known
only to the student, and appreciated only by the scholar. If thou
art not interested in them, it is either because thou art not gifted
with a love for the simple and the beautiful, or else because that
simplicity and beauty have perished in the medium through which
thou hast seen them. I am no man-worshipper, and, I hope, no
nation-worshipper. Yet I love, admire, and venerate the Greeks;
and though I might in liberality allow that there have been minds
more mighty than any of the Grecian race, yet it might be shown
by the strongest of moral proof&mdash;the sentiments of nations, and the
evidence of facts&mdash;that they were the brightest, simplest, and most
<i>classic</i> nation on the earth. I say, it might be shown, and should
occasion serve, I will show it. Meanwhile I will content myself
with the hope that you may be blessed with an <i>Attic reduplication</i>
of wit, a <i>temporal augment</i> in the riches and honors of this world,
and a <i>spiritual aspiration</i> after all that is beautiful in knowledge,
and all that is generous in deed.</p>

<p>To foster a literary spirit, and to furnish a medium for its exercise;
to rescue from utter waste the many thoughts and musings of
a student’s leisure hours; and to afford some opportunity to train

in after life;&mdash;such, and similar motives have urged us to this undertaking.</p>

<p>So long as we confine ourselves to these simple objects, and do

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
